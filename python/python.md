cd read_file
python3 read_file.py data.txt
```

## Log and Text File Parser

This section focuses on parsing log and text files. It includes checking timestamp formats, calculating test elapsed time, storing values that match a specified pattern, and presenting the results.

### Usage

To use the `burn_in_test_log_parser.py` script, execute it with the following format:

```bash
cd log_parser

python3 burn_in_test_log_parser.py burn_in_test_pass.log
python3 burn_in_test_log_parser.py burn_in_test_fail.log
python3 burn_in_test_log_parser.py teraterm.log
```
